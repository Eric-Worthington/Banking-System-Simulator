# Banking-System-Simulator

Developed a terminal-based banking application in Python for ASU’s CIS345 course that simulated customer account management, secure PIN authentication, and transaction processing. The system used JSON for persistent storage and CSV files for transaction logging, with real-time balance updates and input validation. A custom logging module was integrated, and account averages were calculated using Python’s statistics module. The project demonstrated skills in modular programming, structured error handling, and file operations within a user-facing system.
